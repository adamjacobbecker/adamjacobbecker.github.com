My most recent writing can be found on the [DOBT Blog](https://www.dobt.co/blog/author/adam/). It's all standard-issue company blog stuff, like [*Public infrastructure and government IT have a lot in common*](https://www.dobt.co/blog/aging-infrastructure/), [*DOBT's year in review*](https://www.dobt.co/blog/dobts-year-in-review/), and [*Why our free trials no longer have an expiration date*](https://www.dobt.co/blog/free-trials-no-longer-expire/).

I also had a personal blog here for a while, which included some posts that were widely shared in the technology world. (My 15 minutes of fame were for a juvenile blogpost that lambasted the misuse of the "â˜°" icon.)

Writing has taken a backseat to my other endeavors, but I hope to have more regular updates for this page in the future.
