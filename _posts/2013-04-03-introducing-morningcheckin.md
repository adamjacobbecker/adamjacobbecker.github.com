Reading the latest hullabloo about whether [standups are poisonous](http://garethrees.co.uk/2013/03/28/standups-are-poisonous/) [or not](http://www.darianshimy.com/blog/2013/03/30/standups-are-not-poisonous/) made me realize that I forgot to give a proper introduction of [MorningCheckin](http://www.morningcheckin.com), an app originally designed for our team to bring our morning standup meetings online.

The premise of MorningCheckin is simple. Each day, you list:

- What you need to **get done**
- What you **got done**
- Your **flags**, which can be green *"shipped a feature!"*, yellow *"feeling under the weather"*, or red *"my laptop is broken and i can’t work"*

(The cool thing about this is that your **get dones** from yesterday will match with today’s **got dones**.)

MorningCheckin extends a simple interface for viewing what your teammates are working on, and how long ago they last checked in. It even integrates with Campfire if that’s your jam.

I don’t care if you like standups or not, but if you’re gonna [do them asynchronously](http://garethrees.co.uk/2013/03/28/standups-are-poisonous#solution), stay away from the PDFs and consider using this tiny open-source app.
