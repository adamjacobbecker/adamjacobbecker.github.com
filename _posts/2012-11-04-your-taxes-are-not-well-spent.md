title: Your taxes are not well-spent
---

When my mom came to visit me in DC, she brought with her my California jury duty notice. It had arrived at her house, (my address when I first registered to vote,) and after postponing once while I was still in school, it was again my turn to fulfill my civic duty and show up to possibly be selected as a juror. All standard stuff, except for the fact that I won't be living in California for at least another three months, maybe even more. Alright, should be simple enough to postpone it again, right?

I unfolded the response form, looked for the "I've moved" option, and instead found my first point of confusion:

*"D. I am not domiciled in the State of California."*

"Alright," I thought, "there must be a reason they're using a word that sounds more at home in an episode of Downton Abbey than on a form that's *designed for accessibility*. Maybe there's a legal connotation to the word that I'm not aware of?" But as far as I could tell, there wasn't. To make matters even more confusing, this form was telling me to provide a photocopy of military order or other evidence specifying domicile. Hmmâ€¦ maybe I can just write in "wh.gov/innovationfellows" and they'll figure it out? And if I don't fill this out properly, are they really going to follow-up, or just toss in it a pile to be forgotten about?

So I did the best I could to fill out the form, and looked for the included envelope so I that I could mail this important piece of paper back across the country. Then I realized that the envelope wasn't postage-paid, and that I'd first have to go buy a stamp. And then I contemplated writing this blog post, because *how on earth do we, as software developers, let this ridiculousness continue?*

See, we're always writing apps to solve problems and make our own lives easier. For heaven's sake, we have apps that [auto-post our Tweets at pre-specified intervals](http://bufferapp.com), because Tweeting yourself is just too difficult, apps that [tell us when to go to bed](http://sleepyti.me/), because god forbid should I have to do some simple math myself, and about [1,000 different todo list apps](https://play.google.com/store/search?q=todo&c=apps), all created because that other one *wasn't quite perfect*. And I love this. I love that we're using technology to make our lives better, to automate tasks or make them quicker, even to solve problems that we didn't know we had. There's just one thing that confuses me: why are we letting government spend our taxpayer dollars on processing and mailing jury duty forms when any one of us, in probably about a week's time, could build a simple website to replace them? I don't want this to sound like hyperbole, but it's quite seriously a travesty. I mean, I can use [this awesome drag-and-drop interface](https://zapier.com/) to say, start yodeling in our Campfire whenever someone closes a GitHub Issue, yet my tax dollars are still paying for some poor government employee to open envelopes and manually record my jury duty response.

And seriously, think about it: how egregious is it that on voting day we'll all go to a physical polling place, wait in line, and with small exception, cast our votes by marking our choices on pieces of paper?  We need to realize that the longer we let this continue, the more and more we're paying for these inefficiencies, not just in tax dollars but in opportunities lost. The US Census, which exists to help our government better serve us, only occurs once every 10 years, probably because it costs a staggering $42 per capita to execute. And you don't have to take my word that our technology is terrible, you can see evidence all over. You know those disgruntled workers at the DMV? They're probably mad because their computer systems look something like this:

So what can do you? If you're truly entrepreneurial, you'll forge ahead into this underserved market and find yourself not just creating wealth for you and your company, but for the community around you as well. Build that jury duty reporting software, sell it as software-as-a-service to states and counties, and in addition to having an extremely lucrative business, you'll also be saving money and creating value for everyone involved. Sure, if you're selling to governments your market might be finite, but your competition is virtually nonexistent.

We can start to close the growing gap in technology between the public and private sectors, but only if we, as developers, start taking a stand and getting more involved.
