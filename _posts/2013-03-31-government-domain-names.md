It’s a gloomy Easter Sunday here in Oakland, and as I prepare to dive back into a workweek of trying to solve some serious issues in government, I want to take a break and investigate a much more pedantic one: **why is government so terrible at domain names?**

I’ve noticed two major issues:

#### 1. Lack of official “.gov” domains
I can’t be the only one who’s irked when they discover that their city’s website isn't at a sensical location like *OaklandCA.gov*, but at [oaklandnet.com](http://www.oaklandnet.com). Oakland’s not alone either -- San Francisco is [sfgov.org](http://www.sfgov.org/), Albany is [albanyca.org](http://www.albanyca.org), and the brand new Palo Alto website is at [cityofpaloalto.org](http://www.cityofpaloalto.org/). Not only does this annoy the standards geek in me, but it also takes away the perceived legitimacy from these cities’ websites. Which do you trust more, *OaklandCA.gov* or *oaklandnet.com*? Even the standardized ones manage to do it wrong; my nearby cities with more logical URLs all use the practically unrememberable format of *www.ci.CITYNAME.ca.us*.

#### 2. Under-utilization of subdomains
One of the tiny, less talked-about successes of the Obama Administration’s tech policies has been the consolidation of thousands of .gov domains owned by the federal government. The list of [domains owned by federal executive agencies](https://explore.data.gov/Federal-Government-Finances-and-Employment/Federal-Executive-Agency-Internet-Domains-as-of-02/ku4m-7ynp) is crazy; not only is there a [poolsafety.gov](http://www.poolsafety.gov), but there's also a [poolsafely.gov](http://www.poolsafely.gov). The Department of Energy alone owns 79 second-level domains. I understand that sometimes short URLs are necessary for ad campaigns and ease of remembrance, but government is hierarchical and so are domains. Why not turn [knowyourborder.gov](http://knowyourborder.gov/) into *borders.cbp.gov*? When looking for border crossing info, citizens shouldn’t have to know that the US Customs and Border Patrol is responsible for securing our borders. But learning something in the process isn’t a bad thing, especially in a country that’s largely ignorant about the inner workings of its government.

You can see this failing at the local level too. Want the San Francisco police department? They’re not at *police.sfgov.org*, they’ve got their own domain at [sf-police.org](http://sf-police.org). Want Oakland’s civic engagement portal? It’s at [engageoakland.com](http://www.engageoakland.com/), not *engage.oaklandnet.com*, the more logical choice. Not only would the subdomain approach be less expensive and logistically simpler, it would also assure citizens that they’re at a legitimate government website.


#### How did this happen?
Your guess is as good as mine. Maybe it’s because .gov domain names [cost more](http://www.howto.gov/web-content/requirements-and-best-practices/domain-registration) than .coms? Maybe it’s because most local governments don’t want to go through GSA to get their domain name? I’m curious to know if anyone knows the real story, so shoot me an email or let me know on [Twitter](http://www.twitter.com/adamjacobbecker) if you do.

Until I get to the bottom of this, my only ask for my civic tech friends is that they do their best not to create any new domains. I know that once we start implementing [procure.io](http://www.procure.io), I’ll certainly be pushing for *procurement.city.com* and not *cityprocurement.com*.
