<p>Hi, I'm Adam.</p>

<p>I'm a "web developer", "programmer", "technologist", or whatever else you'd like to call me. I've spent the majority of my professional career developing software for the public sector. No, not <a href='#'>this kind</a>. <a href='#'>This kind</a>.</p>

<p>I'm currently working as a freelance technology consultant. My strengths are in making technology choices, adopting best-practices across organizations, organizing, and providing mentorship to junior engineers. </p>

<p>I've worked at all levels of "the stack", and enjoy turning an idea from a concept, to wireframes, to an MVP, to a robust and scalable application.</p>

<p>If you're interested in working together, please [get in touch]().</p>
