I'm from Berkeley, CA, and currently live in Oakland, CA. I've also spent significant time in Portland, Washington DC, and New York City.

I love to spend time outdoors rock climbing, playing soccer, and riding bikes. I'm also a musician and a pretty competitive Scrabble opponent.

I consider myself a [leftist](http://dsausa.org) and am passionate about social and economic justice issues. I have spent the majority of my professional career working to [help citizens understand their government](http://mashable.com/2012/05/14/raise-your-voice-govhub/#B0hAsC2YTsqX), [make government contracting less corrupt](https://www.codeforamerica.org/blog/2013/05/16/rfp-ez/), and [help government better deliver vital services to the people](https://www.dobt.co/). (However, I've become more dubious of technological change without an accompanying political framework.)
