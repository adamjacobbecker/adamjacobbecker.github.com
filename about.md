I'm from Berkeley, CA, and currently reside in Oakland, CA. I've lived in Portland, Washington DC, and New York City.

I love to spend time outdoors. I'm a rock climber, soccer player, cyclist, musician, and a pretty competitive Scrabble opponent.

I consider myself a [leftist](http://dsausa.org) and am passionate about social and economic justice. I have spent the majority of my professional career working to [help citizens understand their government](http://mashable.com/2012/05/14/raise-your-voice-govhub/#B0hAsC2YTsqX), [make government contracting less corrupt](https://www.codeforamerica.org/blog/2013/05/16/rfp-ez/), and [help government better deliver vital services to the people](https://www.dobt.co/). However, I've started to become more dubious of the benefits of these technologies without an accompanying political framework.
