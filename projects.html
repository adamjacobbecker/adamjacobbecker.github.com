    <p class='project-description'>
      At the Department of Better Technology, I led a small team in the creation of <a href='https://www.dobt.co/screendoor/'>Screendoor</a>, a SaaS product that provides a complete workflow for paperless forms. Screendoor is used by dozens of governments, from small cities like Oakland, CA, to large federal agencies like the State Department and the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. I authored the majority of Screendoor's Ruby on Rails codebase, helped design many of its features, and was responsible for its deployment as well.

    <p class='project-footnote'>Skills used: Ruby on Rails, PostgreSQL, Redis, Resque, Backbone.js, Sass, Amazon Web Services</p>

    <h3>Dispatch</h3>

    <p>
      <a href='https://github.com/dobtco/dispatch'>Dispatch</a> was another DOBT product that never really took off, but it was technically interesting and a lot of fun to develop. We built it for the City of Philadelphia, after winning an award to develop an open-source successor to <a href='http://bigideasphl.com'>bigideasphl.com</a>. Unlike Screendoor, Dispatch was open-source, and was designed to be customizable without overriding the core codebase, alleviating many of the issues that befell projects like Adopt-a-Hydrant, where the project was forked many times over, and never reconciled into a single upstream repository.
    </p>
    <p class='project-footnote'>Dispatch was developed as a standard-issue Rails application. I also designed the initial mockups, prototype, and proposal that won us the RFP award.</p>

    <p class='project-description'>
      Worked with the CTO of the White House and the US Small Business Administration to build RFP-EZ, a platform that makes it easier for small, high-growth businesses to navigate the federal procurement process, and enable agencies to quickly source low-cost, high-impact information technology solutions.
