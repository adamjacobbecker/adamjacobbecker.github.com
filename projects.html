    <p>
      At the Department of Better Technology, I led a small team that created <a href='https://www.dobt.co/screendoor/'>Screendoor</a>, a SaaS product that provides a complete workflow for paperless forms. Screendoor is used by dozens of government agencies, from small cities like Oakland, CA, to large federal agencies like the State Department and the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. I authored the majority of Screendoor's Ruby on Rails codebase and helped design many of its features, and was responsible for its robust and scalable deployment.

    <h3>Dispatch</h3>

    <p>
      <a href='https://github.com/dobtco/dispatch'>Dispatch</a> was another DOBT product that never really took off, but it was technically interesting and a lot of fun to develop. We built it for the City of Philadelphia, after winning an award to develop an open-source successor to <a href='http://bigideasphl.com'>bigideasphl.com</a>. Dispatch was designed to be customizable without overriding the core codebase, unlike other civic tech projects which were forked many times over, and never reconciled into a single upstream repository.
    </p>
    <p>Dispatch was developed as a standard-issue Rails application. I also designed the initial mockups, prototype, and proposal that won us the RFP award.</p>

    <p>
    As a <a href="https://presidentialinnovationfellows.gov/">Presidential Innovation Fellow</a>, I worked with the US CTO and the Deputy Administrator of the Small Business Administration to build RFP-EZ, a platform that made it easier for small, high-growth businesses to navigate the federal procurement process, and enable agencies to quickly source low-cost, high-impact information technology solutions. On a per-project basis, bids received through RFP-EZ were consistently lower than those received through FedBizOps, <a href="https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/blog/2013/05/15/rfp-ez-delivers-savings-taxpayers-new-opportunities-small-business">saving the government over 30% on average</a>.

    <h3>GovHub</h3>
    <p>
      I was the first tech hire at GovHub.org, the first website to give you a comprehensive, geographically-calculated list of your government officials from federal to local level.
