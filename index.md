Hi, I'm Adam.

I'm a "web developer", "programmer", "technologist", or whatever else you'd like to call me. I've spent the majority of my professional career developing software for the public sector, first as a [Presidential Innovation Fellow](https://presidentialinnovationfellows.gov/), and most recently as a co-founder of [DOBT](https://www.dobt.co).

I'm currently working as a freelance tech consultant. My strengths include making pragmatic technology choices, helping teams adopt industry best-practices, and providing guidance and mentorship to junior engineers.

I've worked at all levels of the stack, and enjoy turning an idea from a concept, to wireframes, an MVP, and finally, a robust and scalable application.

If you're interested in working together, please [get in touch](mailto:ad(at)mbecker(dot)cc).
